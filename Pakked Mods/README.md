# Glassworks

Caveats and known issues:
- [ ] **CRITICAL** Store items compiled with Hydronix store in mind, are not accessible to non-Hydronix users (fix in progress...)
- [ ] **URGENT** Store hook removes Simple Chair from store (fix in progress...)
- [ ] _IMPENDING_ Simple Collision Hull incorrectly shaped (Affects certain physics interactions) (Fix imminent...)
- [ ] Build gridguides not showing up (fix in progress...)
- [ ] Unable to highlight-outline glass objects (possible limitation of game itself)
- [ ] Glass material, especially its transparent and refractive properties, may cause deleterious framelag at high vis counts
