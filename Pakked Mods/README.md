## Glassworks

Caveats and known issues:
[!] Store hook removes Simple Chair from store (fix in progress...)
[!] Store items compiled with Hydronix store in mind, might not be so accessible to non-Hydronix users (fix in consideration...)
[â€¦] Simple Collision Hull incorrectly shaped (Affects certain physics interactions) (Fix imminent...)
[ ]  Build gridguides not showing up (fix in progress...)
[ ] Unable to highlight-outline glass objects (possible limitation of game itself)
[ ] Glass material, especially its transparent and refractive properties, may cause deleterious framelag at high vis counts
