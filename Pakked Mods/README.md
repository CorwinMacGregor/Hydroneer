# Glassworks

Caveats and known issues:
- [ ] **URGENT** Attempting to place glass buildables in non-placeable open world areas results in being unable to exit placement mode
- [ ] **URGENT** Store hook removes Simple Chair from store (research in progress…)
- [ ] Build gridguides not showing up (research in progress…)
- [ ] Unable to highlight-outline glass objects (possible limitation of game itself, according to Max)
- [ ] Glass material, especially its transparent and refractive properties, may cause deleterious framelag at high vis counts
- [X] AVERTED: **CRITICAL** Store items compiled with Hydronix store in mind, are not accessible to non-Hydronix users (requires Hydronix Store or MacGregor Emporium)
- [X] FIXED: Simple Collision Hull incorrectly shaped (Affects certain physics interactions)

# MacGregor Emporium
At this time, this is a simple break-out of Hydronix Store code from the Hydronix Core.

All credit still due to Team Hydronix

Caveats and known issues:
- [x] **URGENT** Castle walls and second floor are not being spawned in
