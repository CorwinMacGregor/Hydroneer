## Glassworks

Caveats and known issues:
* Store hook removes Simple Chair from store (fix in progress...)
* Store items compiled with Hydronix store in mind, might not be so accessible to non-Hydronix users (fix in consideration...)
* Glass material, especially its transparent and refractive properties, may cause deleterious framelag at high vis counts
