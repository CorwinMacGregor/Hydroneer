# Glassworks

Caveats and known issues:
- [X] **CRITICAL** Store items compiled with Hydronix store in mind, are not accessible to non-Hydronix users (requires Hydronix-Store)
- [ ] **URGENT** Attempting to place glass buildables in non-placeable open world areas results in being unable to exit placement mode
- [ ] **URGENT** Store hook removes Simple Chair from store (research in progress…)
- [ ] _IMPENDING_ Simple Collision Hull incorrectly shaped (Affects certain physics interactions) (Fix imminent…)
- [ ] Build gridguides not showing up (research in progress…)
- [ ] Unable to highlight-outline glass objects (possible limitation of game itself, according to Max)
- [ ] Glass material, especially its transparent and refractive properties, may cause deleterious framelag at high vis counts
